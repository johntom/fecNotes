================= May 11 ====================

**General Issues**
1. need to be systematic and judicious about when we use pop up to tell you to save or that you have saved
 * if i have 2 inventory items opened from a search and i am switching between them to figure out which is the one i want to edit, I get a message asking me if I want to leave the form without saving even thought I haven't changed anything
 * if I click "stay & save" I then have to click ok in the pop up that tells me that I have saved
 * I believe there have been times where I changed something on a tab form and then was able to switch to another tab without saving and without getting a warning
2. When we use a pop up to fill in a look up field instead of a dropdown we have to follow the rules of Capitalization & spaces between words that they are so nutty about 
3. I think the header font is a little big on these pop up forms

**inventory form: header fields**
1. remove MRG Location field
2. are keywords adding on the fly?
3. think from Hoopers notes we need all 4 dimension fields
 * Size (no need to say “unframed”)
 * Sight size
 * Framed size
 * Image size

**General Tab Issues**
1. when on a 1:many tab form, if I click the "Update" button to edit a record, the whole page tries to reload and it gets stuck
2. These are (I think) all the tabs that use the pop up forms which need to have the formatting/wording changed. 
 * Conserved By
 * Sold To
 * Purchased From
 * Loan To
 * Consigned To
 * Consigned From  (there are 2 pop ups on this tab)

3. These are the things that have to be checked
 * name of form: make sure the name corresponds to the form and that it has a space between words: Consigned To not Consignedto
 * the text where it says "type any characters of the Purchased From (not PurchasedFrom) to select
 * make sure the words in the box that you are typing into correspond to the correct field (see Purchased From & loan To)


**Prov Tab**
add+ button gives a message when you click it, I believe it's the only one


**Exhibition Tab***
I think there is still an extra field here (from when you were considering choosing a reproduction to associate)
so the column headings are off

**Conservation Tab**
1. Still has (title ct:) in the header of the tab
2. Labels that need correction: label ConservedBy, InvoiceNo and Cmd

**Sold To Tab**
Check dropdown for Payment Method

**Purchased From Tab**
1. still has the word "Purchased" needs to conform to Sold To tab 
2. correct PaymentNo and Notes

**Loan To  Tab**
1. Ins Value,  Ins Amt,  MRG Signed, Institution Signed, Note, Updated Fact Sheet
2. We have to check on these fields: cofl? Artwork field date? 

**Consigned To**
1. check column labels
2. not sure if they need them but are created and modified dates being generated?

**Consigned From Tab**
Labels: Notes, netPrice

**Editions Tab**
publisher and printer locations not saving

I would use blue for the “+ add” button on the tabs
(it is currently a mix of blue & green)

Should the tab that is currently displayed turn blue so it is easy to identify?

I think the heading font on each of the tabs is too large, we might discuss what this should look like

Switching between Cosignedto/Museumloan/Insurance/Vat/Purchased/Consigned- can take a really long time, the rest of the tabs respond quickly

Notes Tab
   x 1.    “+ add” button is green
   x 2.    Inventory Title not inc in heading

Exhibition Tab
    x 1.    “+ add” button is blue

    5.    can not edit existing data
    6.    clicking update brings up live fields in a strange places:
        If you enter data in any of the live fields, it fills all the fields except “ConcervedBy”
        “ConservedBy” gets replaced by a date field
        When you enter data in the live field that appears under “Treatment” it wants to auto fill with email address data that is stored on my machine locally
        the live fields that appear under “Dates” & “Invoice No” don’t have that behavior
